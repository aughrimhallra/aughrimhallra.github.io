## [0.1.0] - 2022-07-01

New plugin required

## Justification

The `ZTP Ops` plugin is being created to manage the variables, jobs and interface to ZTP-ing devices, so that other projects can use GraphQL/API calls to manage ZTP processes, thus removing he need for the outdated and convoluted `DeviceStatusChange` Plugin.
