## Pre-requisites

Before starting the process, I would suggest that you check you have the correct password for the email account by testing the same via the [webmail login](https://altmail.blacknight.com).

- The username is always the full email address, i.e. _commitee@ahra.ie_.
- The password is that of the email account as provided by the webmaster.

If you find that the login is not working via the webmail then the likelihood is you do not have the correct password, contact Stuart at #42.

## Setting up Email on Outlook

!!! note
    On the newer versions of Outlook for Mac you will need to disable the _sync to cloud_ feature for the email account when setting it up as otherwise it will not complete the setup.

If the _sync to cloud_ option is not present you can skip this part, you can do this on the screen where you supply the details for the connection. There is a item called "Not IMAP" (top right) which you click then select "Switch off Cloud Sync",  you can then complete the setup process as per the below.

When you first add your email address to the add email account process, after a few clicks to setup it will end up on the following screen; choose "IMAP/POP" from the list.

The following screen will then look like this - amend:

- Amend _email@domain.com_ to the email address you are setting up. i.e. _chairperson@ahra.ie_
- Set the password for that email account.
- Enter the hostname as shown for Incoming and Outgoing server.
- Set the Ports as shown.
- Ensure all tick boxes are set as shown.

Then click [Add Account](#){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD042-->
Provided you have entered the details correctly it should make a connection without issue. If it fails the password is likely incorrect or there is a typo in details entered.

The following screen is also what should be listed on an already added email account. Note the highlighted bits - you amend and set accordingly based on your details, email account and preferences.
