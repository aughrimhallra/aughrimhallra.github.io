## Pre-requisites

Before starting the process, I would suggest that you check you have the correct password for the email account by testing the same via the [webmail login](https://altmail.blacknight.com).

- The username is always the full email address, i.e. _commitee@ahra.ie_.
- The password is that of the email account as provided by the webmaster.

If you find that the login is not working via the webmail then the likelihood is you do not have the correct password, contact Stuart at #42.
